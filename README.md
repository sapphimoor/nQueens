# nQueens
A very simple _n_ queens puzzle solver written in c.

To use this program, run this in a terminal and answer the prompt `Input problem size: n = ` with the size of the problem you want to solve.
If you input less than or equals 0 then this program alerts to you and suggests `Input problem size AGAIN: n = ` so answer again.

Options:
- `-n` ( or `--number`) : show the answer in a (row, col) form
- `-b` ( or `--board` ) : show the answer in a visualised board
- `-c` ( or `--count` ) : show only number of answer
